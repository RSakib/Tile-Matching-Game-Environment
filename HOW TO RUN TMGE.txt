You must update to the newest version of Java

If you are on a windows PC, simply click RunGame.Bat to get the TMGE running

java -jar --module-path javafx-sdk-19.0.2.1/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.media,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics Tile-Matching-Game-Environment.jar


Once the game is running, there's a few things that can be done

There is a button to increase or decrease the amount of players that will be playing, Players are done as a turn system
Think similar to the original Super Mario Bros., one player goes until their game ends and then hands it off to the next
player

There is a button to view the players and scores
	This will show highest scores and player names as you play through games
There are two buttons labeled "Tetris" and "Bejeweled"

Clicking on either button will run the respective game
However Before a game starts, it will ask for a player name as a player profile
	It will do this before every game for as many players that were inputed in the main menu screen

ShiftLeft : A
ShiftRight : D
ShiftDown : S

Bejeweled Controls:
